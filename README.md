##Equipment Checkout
=======

The purpose of this application is to allow users to checkout equipment from the ASU Student Union and allow administrators to sign out and in on the pieces as well as log the user's information onto a database.

Upon opening the web page you're shown a couple of things:

- The Header which has links to home, make request, and login
- A greeting box that can link you to request creation

On the request creation page you can make a request for some of the available equipment as well as enter your name, email, and SID-or 907#.

On the Login page, an administrator can login and do all sorts of administrative tasks such as:

- Index, add, edit, and delete equipment
- Index, add, edit, and delete other administrators
- Index, sign out, sign in and delete requests
  
And that's basically the site.
